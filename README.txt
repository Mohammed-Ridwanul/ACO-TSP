TSP - AICUP2010 - README - Stefano Pongelli 

This program has been implemented in JAVA using the Eclipse IDE.
Just import the folder structure into Eclipse, select in the Main 
class the number of the problem you want to check, and click run.

If you want to plot the graph of the best solution each time a better ant is found,
just set "toPlot" to true. You need to install JFreeChart library.

The source code is inside the folder SRC instead of the one called CODE as required.
The problems file are located in "src/problems/"

Description, excel file, parameters, best solutions file and screenshots of the plots 
are inside SOLUTION folder.
